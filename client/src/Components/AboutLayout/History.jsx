        Political parties are enduring organizations under whose labels
        candidates seek and hold elective offices (Epstein, 1986). Parties
        develop and implement rules governing elections. They help organize
        government leadership (Key Jr., 1964). Political parties have been
        likened to public utilities, such as water and power companies, because
        they provide vital services for a democracy. The endurance and
        adaptability of American political parties is best understood by
        examining their colorful historical development. Parties evolved from
        factions in the eighteenth century to political machines in the
        nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, parties underwent waves
        of reform that some argue initiated a period of decline. The renewed
        parties of today are service-oriented organizations dispensing
        assistance and resources to candidates and politicians (Aldrich, 1995;
        Eldersveld & Walton Jr., 2000).
